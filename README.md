# The Blink Challenge

[Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/) is a website and service platform that condenses leading non-fiction books into 15 minute, bite-sized "blinks". It extracts all the core parts of the book and makes it quick to consume. I have been using it for a couple weeks, and I am completely hooked. It is educationaly sound by following the [microlearning](https://www.lynda.com/Camtasia-tutorials/microlearning-right-strategy-you/734647/793988-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3amicrolearning%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) learning paradigm, supports life-long learning patterns, and encourages a [polymathic](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/polymathic) lifestyle. 

So naturally I wanted to start a challenge with you all! 
7 days, 7 blinked books!

In my upcoming book, I talk about three core components needed for a successful learning plan:
- Curriculum
- Structure / Accountability
- Mentorship

The blinks themselves are the curriculum. It is the content we are engaging in.
The challenge serves as a structure. Its the accountability mechanism in which we engage in to ensure we come back each day. P
Finally, the mentorship piece is a peer mentorship. We are going to learn and discuss together!

For this first sprint, I have laid out 7 great / well known books that have been 'blinked'. The challenge is to listen to, or read the blinked version of the book, then hop into the #blinkchallenge channel on Slack for discussion as a community. Gathering other peoples insights from the same blink will offer new perspectives as well as strengthen your own understanding of the topic of the book. Once the challenge is done, we will open up a submission form to recommend books, and then ultimately vote on the next blinked books for next sprint. The cadence of the challenge will coincide with the 'off-week' of the GitHub Challenge. 

What do you think?

**Note**: I did sign up to become an affiliate for Blinkist. Couldn't help myself, I have been talking about Blinkist with anyone who will listen. What this means, is that if you use my link, and convert to a paid plan, I get a spiff. But, I did make the challenge so that you could squeak into their free trial (7-days). You can also totally not use my link and sign up normal, I absolutely will not be offended. I care much more about you learning than a spiff. But on that note, know that all 'spiffness' is going to getting my book professionally edited.

Blinkist costs:
- $79.99 / year, or,
- $12.99 / month
- Free for 7 days, but you HAVE to cancel before the end of the trial or you get billed for the year.
