# The Blink Challenge

[Blinkist](http://jump.blinkist.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=5291) is a website and service platform that condenses leading non-fiction books into 15 minute, bite-sized "blinks". It extracts all the core parts of the book and makes it quick to consume. I have been using it for a couple weeks, and I am completely hooked. It is educationaly sound by following the [microlearning](https://www.lynda.com/Camtasia-tutorials/microlearning-right-strategy-you/734647/793988-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3amicrolearning%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) learning paradigm, supports life-long learning patterns, and encourages a [polymathic](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/polymathic) lifestyle. 

So naturally I wanted to start a challenge with you all! 
7 days, 7 blinked books!

In the book I am currently writting, I talk about three core components needed for a successful learning plan:
- Curriculum / Content
- Structure / Accountability
- Mentorship

The blinks themselves are the curriculum. It is the content we are engaging in.
Like the GitHub Challenge, the goal for this challenge is daily learning. So this challenge serves as an accountability and structure component, to ensure we engage each day. Finally, the mentorship piece is a peer mentorship. We are going to learn and discuss together!

For this first sprint, I have laid out 7 great / well known books that have been 'blinked'. The challenge is to listen to, or read the blinked version of the book, then hop into the #blinkchallenge channel on Slack for discussion as a community. Gathering other peoples insights from the same blink will offer new perspectives as well as strengthen your own understanding of the topic of the book. Once the challenge is done, we will open up a submission form to recommend books, and then ultimately vote on the next blinked books for next sprint. The cadence of the challenge will coincide with the 'off-week' of the GitHub Challenge. 

What do you think?

Blinkist costs:
- $79.99 / year, or,
- $12.99 / month
- Free for 7 days, but you HAVE to cancel before the end of the trial or you get billed for the year. 

_Note: After I started creating the challenge, I was made aware that Blinkist had an affiliate program. What this means is that if you end up converting to a yearly membership, I get a spiff. Using my links does not cost you anything extra. It just means that Blinkist recognizes that I am advocating for their platform and they reward me for that. In no way, shape or form, do you need to use any of the links on this page. Feel free to sign up 100% on your own. It does not exclude you in the challenge._

_This is about learning and communicating with other people in a daily learning format. The challenge was designed to fit into the free trial period. And I will remind everyone on the last day of the challenge to cancel their memberships if they do not want to continue using it!_

_Also note that I do not have access at all to membership information or have the ability to modify memberships._

_Final note, proceeds from the affiliate program will go into getting my first book, Furious Growth, professionally edited._

### Want to sign up? Awesome.

Three things I need from you:
- Sign up with this form here. It helps me keep track of who is engaged with the challenge and helps me connect you with Slack.
- Sign up for a Blinkist Challenge Slack account. That is where the action happens! You could obviously Blink books on your own, but significant traction in retention can happen if you chat about what you learned with others. Join the community! Come hang with us!
- Finally, sign up for [Blinkist](http://jump.blinkist.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=5291) on the first day of the challenge (November 1st, 2018)!

Further directions will be communicated on our Slack channel!
