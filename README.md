# The Blink Challenge

[Blinkist](http://jump.blinkist.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=5291) is a website and service platform that condenses leading non-fiction books into 15 minute, bite-sized "blinks". It extracts all the core parts of the book and makes it quick to consume. I have been using it for a couple weeks, and I am completely hooked. It is educationally sound by following the [microlearning](https://www.lynda.com/Camtasia-tutorials/microlearning-right-strategy-you/734647/793988-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3amicrolearning%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) paradigm, supports life-long learning patterns, and encourages a [polymathic](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/polymathic) lifestyle. 

Personally, I have an intense focus on helping people craft daily learning habits. So naturally I wanted to start a challenge with you all! 7 days, 7 blinked books!

In the book I am currently writing, I talk about three core components needed for a successful learning plan:
- Curriculum / Content
- Structure / Accountability
- Mentorship

The blinks themselves are the curriculum. It is the content we are engaging in.
Like the GitHub Challenge, the goal for this challenge is daily learning. So this challenge serves as an accountability and structure component, to ensure we engage each day. Finally, the mentorship piece is a peer mentorship. When we engage in discussion with others and hear their perspectives while voicing our own, we understand things better. 

For this first sprint, I have laid out 7 great / well known books that have been 'blinked'. The challenge is to listen to, or read the blinked version of the book, then hop into the Slack Channel created for this challenge, for discussion as a community. Gathering other peoples insights from the same blink will offer new perspectives as well as strengthen your own understanding of the topic of the book. Once the challenge is done, we will open up a submission form to recommend books, and then ultimately vote on the next blinked books for next sprint. The cadence of the challenge will follow the 1st of the month, to the 7th. Then we will continue the conversation of the month's books while voting on the next the rest of the month. This is subject to change, but the challenge fits into the trail period of Blinkist.

### Want to sign up? Awesome.

Three things I need from you:
- Sign up with this [form here](https://goo.gl/forms/mmBvq3wdAOlKITk33). It helps me keep track of who is engaged with the challenge and helps me connect you with Slack.
- Sign up for a [Blink Challenge Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/blinkchallenge/shared_invite/enQtNDYyMzk4NTY0NjI3LWZiZWE4OTM3NmYxYTA2YTNlY2U0NGUzMDljNzMzYWNlOGEzMDk5YmVkNGU2ZmFhNjJiZDQxNmE3YzI5OGY5NDE) account. That is where the action happens! You could obviously Blink books on your own, but significant traction in retention can happen if you chat about what you learned with others. Join the community! Come hang with us!
- Finally, sign up for [Blinkist](http://jump.blinkist.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=5291) on the first day of the challenge (November 1st, 2018)!
